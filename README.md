## 🚀 Key Professional Impact & Achievements

My work focuses on delivering quantifiable improvements across the SDLC:

* **Platform Resilience:** Architected and maintained **multi-region failover** for **Kubernetes** clusters, achieving **$100\%$ service availability** and ensuring stability during **$3\text{X peak traffic}$** events.
* **Operational Efficiency:** **Automated critical incident workflow** by integrating GCP native alerts with **ServiceNow**, resulting in a **$30\%$ reduction in Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)**.
* **Uptime & Observability:** Drove a **$15\%$ improvement in system uptime** and achieved successful **zero-downtime upgrades** by implementing comprehensive **Prometheus/Grafana** observability stacks.
* **Deployment Quality:** Streamlined **CI/CD** pipelines and implemented **Blue/Green** deployment strategies, reducing high-severity post-deployment incidents by **$98\%$**.
* **IaC Standardization:** Standardized infrastructure using **Terraform (IaC)**, which **reduced environment spin-up time by $75\%$** and achieved **$99\%$ environment consistency**.
* **Container Optimization:** Optimized container image packaging with **Docker**, **reducing build times by $35\%$** and improving resource utilization across the Kubernetes cluster.
